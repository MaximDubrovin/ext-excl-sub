    <h1>
        Problem with reusing subscriptions
    </h1>

    <p>
        Something in Meteor doesn't extend already received documents with new fields from later subscriptions.
    </p>

    <h2>
        What we have?
    </h2>

    <p>
        «Posts» collection with one post document:
    </p>

    {{{gist "MaximDubrovin" "8151ae939b3d1f388b70"}}}

    <p>
        Post title is a document which contains <em>published</em> field and <em>unpublished</em> field (for title draft version).
    </p>

    <h2>Scenario where problem emerges:</h2>

    <p>
        <em>See MongoInspector at the bottom-left corner to track what data available on the client.</em>
    </p>

    <p>1. Click the button and subscribe to Posts with excluded «title.unpublished» field:</p>

    <button onclick="Meteor.subscribe('posts_unpublished_fields_explicitly_excluded');">
        Meteor.subscribe('posts_unpublished_fields_explicitly_excluded')
    </button>

    {{{gist "MaximDubrovin" "7da40dc3264b184ddd7c"}}}

    <p>
        See MongoInspector: no «title.unpublished» field for the title.
    </p>

    <p>2. Click the button and subscribe to Posts without any fields exclusion:</p>

    <button onclick="Meteor.subscribe('posts_no_fields_exclusion_or_inclusion');">
        Meteor.subscribe('posts_no_fields_exclusion_or_inclusion')
    </button>

    {{{gist "MaximDubrovin" "a8d5f5e9c227492c274e"}}}

    <p>
        See MongoInspector: no «title.unpublished» field for the title, but subscription includes it. Why?
    </p>

    <p>
        3. Click the button and subscribe to Posts with explicitly included «title.unpublished» field:
    </p>

    <button onclick="Meteor.subscribe('posts_unpublished_fields_explicitly_included');">
        Meteor.subscribe('posts_unpublished_fields_explicitly_included')
    </button>

    {{{gist "MaximDubrovin" "ccb2edfbd33e8161b294"}}}

    <p>
        See MongoInspector: no «title.unpublished» field for the title but subscription includes it. Why?
    </p>

    <hr/>

    <p>
        Note: on step 2 or 3 after step 1 we didn't unsubscribe from step 1 subscription.
        We wanted to reuse it and just extend with «title.unpublished» field. It didn't happen.
    </p>

    <h2>Possible explanations</h2>

    <p>
        1. Meteor treats fields exclusion rule as a strict rule and if something was excluded in earlier subscription
        then while this subscription still alive no other subscription can get that excluded data.
    </p>

    <p>
        If so then try to do step 2 or 3 and then step 1. If theory above is valid then subscription on step 1 should remove «title.unpublished» field and add only «title.published» field. But no one of that happened.
    </p>

    <p>
        2. It seems that Meteor ignores later subscriptions that includes/excludes fields of the already received document.
    </p>

    <p>
        Theory 1: Meteor do it on purpose which is unknown.
    </p>

    <p>
        Or Meteor simply doesn't have mechanism to compare which fields of the already received documents should be extended/excluded after new subscription.
    </p>

    <p>
        So we have earlier subscription data in favor of later subscription data.
    </p>

    <h2>
        Problem which you can face when building app:
    </h2>

    <p>
        For example you logged in user that created a post.
        You are on public version of that post (subscribed to public post data). www.blog.com/:postId
    </p>

    <p>
        Then you decide to edit it and go to www.blog.com/:postId/edit route.
        You don't want to unsubscribe from post data you already have. It anyway be useful in near feature.
        You want to extend it with something like «title.unpublished» and «content.unpublished»
        since on www.blog.com/:postId/edit you want to see draft version of the post.
    </p>

    <p>But you can't do it.</p>

    <p>
        You need to completely unsubscribe from previous data and then subscribe again but with included «.unpublished» fields.
    </p>

    <p>
        It doesn't matter if you use Meteor.subscribe like in that example or meteorhacks:subs-manager.
        Something in Meteor doesn't extend already received documents with new fields.
    </p>
